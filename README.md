# Fondamenti-di-Programmazione
Final Project for my C-language first year course, together with the exercises for said course.
The project requested to code a program that counted occurrences and positions for words in a large texts. Exercises are pretty standard, badly commentated and named (in Italian) because I knew even less that what I know today.
